    <p> In case you haven't picked up on it yet, my name is Dirk Hortensius. I'm a Seattle-based professional geek and amatuer musician. By day I upgrade and maintain the Amazon digital store with my team (and our dozen sister teams), and by night I like to play loud music. However, both of these statements assume I've managed to find my pants that day. Fuck pants. </p>
