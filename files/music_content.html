<h3>Dante</h3>
<p>Les Paul Studio 200. Seymour Duncan Hot Rod Pickups. Set up for Half-Down with a 12-guage set. My primary rock guitar, but plays any metal that is tuned above Drop-C. My first electric. Relatively cheap, but an overall solid guitar that sounds better than guitars 10x its original price (perhaps because I've sunk over twice its original price in upgrading it).</p>

<h3>Mikhael</h3>
<p>Ibanez ART-200. Seymour Duncan Hot Rod Pickups. Set up for Drop-B with a custom heavy gauge string set (Low-E is a 7-string Low-B). Originally intentioned and tailored exclusively for Metal, though has begun seeing use as my progressive guitar due to its clean tone on the forward humbucker.</p>

<h3>Fang</h3>
<p>Ibanez 7-string. Unknown EMG Pickups. Originally owned by Ryan ____. Used for all my Djent Metal and anything else tuned that low.</p>

<h3>Sheila</h3>
<p>Ibanez Acoustic Something. Primary Acoustic Beater. Doesn't sound the prettiest, and she's sporting a mortal wound in her frame, but she's my anytime guitar.</p>

<h3>Sarah</h3>
<p>Taylor Acoustic. Provided you're on a new set of strings, the pretiest sound you'll ever hear without an amp.</p>

<h3>Lydia</h3>
<p>Cheap-Ass Mitchel 12-string. Special Ability: making any 4-chord song sound transcendent.</p>

<h3>Brad</h3>
<p>Squier Skull Bass. Shitty starter Bass, but great in the low tones.</p>

<h3>Ivan</h3>
<p>Ibanez SG-550. Originally bought for being a 5-string so I can play Korn, fell in love with the high range tones. Perfect in the mids for Tool.</p>
